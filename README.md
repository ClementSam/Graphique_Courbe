# Graphique Courbe

This project is a graphical application for managing plots.

## Setup

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

When importing curves from files (CSV, JSON, BIN, etc.) a selection dialog
lets you choose which curves are actually added to the project.
